# Lesson 3 (Level 1) — OpenCV Ball Tracking + Push into Goal

Goal:
- use OpenCV to find a coloured ball
- steer to centre it
- drive forward to push into the goal

This is intentionally simple:
- detect ball centre (cx)
- if ball is left: strafe left
- if ball is right: strafe right
- if centred: drive forward
